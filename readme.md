# Uber Clone Project

A full-stack **Uber-like ride-hailing web application** built as a learning and practice project. The goal of this project is to understand **frontend–backend integration**, real-world app structure, and scalable web application design.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is inspired by **Uber** and simulates core ride-hailing features such as booking rides, managing users, and handling backend APIs. The repository is divided into **frontend** and **backend** for clean separation of concerns.
